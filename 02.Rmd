## What's that pattern?

You see a knit garment that you must have, but without a pattern, it is difficult to recreate.  

## Here, have a pattern!

Siliki takes as its input an image of a knit garment, identifies the garment, stitch pattern(s), and guage. The user inputs the required measurements, and Siliki produces a custom pattern to recreate the garment.

*image recognition*- What kind of garment? What kind of stitch? What's the guage? What's the yarn? 
*simple calculation*- Based on the kind of garment, stitch patterns, and guage Siliki can calculate stitch counts, shaping, etc.
*machine learning* -Recommended yarn, other recommended patterns

If there are errors in the pattern that can be fixed by the user, they may be uploaded to Siliki's website to inform future patterns.  If the user needs help, Siliki will have talented knitwear designers to provide a fix to the user and the database.

Patterns created utilizing Siliki will be copyrighted to Siliki.  All copyright laws will apply.

## Let's knit!

Now that the user has a pattern, the knitting is up to them.  While the ability to obtain a pattern for any garment opens up doors for users, it complicates the current knitwear design ecosystem.  Currently, knitwear design is an artform.  Designers pour significant effort into creating and publishing patterns.  Some designers even depend on sales of their patterns for their livelihood. Something like Siliki, though not infringing on copyright, would open the door for copycat designs that may jeopardize these sales. Designers may respond by reducing the number of photos in their patterns, or otherwise modify the patterns to reduce the effectiveness of Siliki.
